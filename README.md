# AssessmentEngine

Web application used for creating and administering studies for research at the Loss, Trauma, and Emotion Lab for the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology at Columbia University.

In the administration portal a variety of versions of the EFT Assessment can be configured and setup for study participants. This application was created to enable research to continue in a remote setting during the pandemic when in person assessments could not be administered due to COVID-19.
